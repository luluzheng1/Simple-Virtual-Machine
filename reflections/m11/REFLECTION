1.  Python Lists allow users to initialize an list like:
    a_list = [x for x in range(100)]
    This allows the user to write code without thinking about allocation at all.

2.  Below is the valgrind output for running alloc.vo through the svm 
    The only test passed.
    Requested 48,554 bytes in 1,010 allocations
    4 garbage collections copied 2,285 bytes
    The collector copied 0.05 bytes for every byte requested
    At exit, heap contained 2 used pages and 3 available pages
    Total heap size is 32,000 bytes held in 5 pages
    ==30721==
    ==30721== HEAP SUMMARY:
    ==30721==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
    ==30721==   total heap usage: 1,523 allocs, 471 frees, 261,743 bytes
                allocated
    ==30721==
    ==30721== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible

    ==30721== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v

3.  Registers are scanned on lines 650 in vmheap.c. We know how many registers 
    to scan because we perform an explicit check, we determine the biggest 
    register index to scan by adding 255 to our current register window on line 
    645. This is liberal, and we plan to make it more conservative in the 
    future. Literals are scanned on lines 656. We know how many literals to 
    scan because we have a num_literals variable in the VMState representation.

4.  Line 310 in vmrun.c initializes the payload for a ConsCell. The VMNEW macro
    expands to initializing the payload's forwarded pointer to NULL on line 2
    of gcmeta.h.

5.  If a value that's gray or black is placed on the gray stack a second time, 
    then the value and its successors would then be copied a second time to 
    to-space. To-space would contain duplicate values, which takes up 
    unnecessary memory. Furthermore, the pointer previously pointing to the 
    first copied object would be lost, so we lose memory.

6.  VMSAVE flushes the current register-window pointer because the pointer
    might point to heap-allocated data. Any heap-allocated data might move 
    during garbage collection, so the register-window pointer has to be flushed 
    to the cache.

7.  An Instruction * pointer is considered an "interior pointer", which is a 
    pointer to some memory location within a heap object, but not to the 
    beginning of the heap object. The garbage collector then needs to find the 
    start of the object, which greatly complicates code. Without knowing the 
    size of the object, it is difficult to do this. This is a barrier to 
    performant garbage collection.

8.  After a string has been copied, its forward pointer becomes NON-NULL. If
    forward_string copies a payload without checking its forwarding pointer,
    it might copy the value that's already copied. We would lose the forwarded
    pointer, so now we lose access to the previously copied value.

9.  I would increase gamma to set the heap-growth policy parameter to do less 
    work. This is because a larger gamma requires a larger heap, which means
    that more memory holds no data. This memory is used to reduce time spent
    collecting and time determining whether an object needs to be freed. To
    trade time for space, I would decrease gamma, which means that there are
    less allocations between collections, so there is more work to be done.

10. If a string value appears in two different VM registers, whichever value in 
    the register that comes first in ascending order will be forwarded first. 
    When scanning the second register, the string will already have been 
    forwarded, therefore it's forwarded pointer is NON-NULL and it won't be 
    copied a second time. Rather it will just return same forwarded pointer, 
    p->forwarded on line 423 in vmheap.c.
